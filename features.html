      Tuff Truck Parts <sup>TM</sup> is a vehicle modification company based just outside of Waco Texas. The company was created by <strong>Ryan Lalik</strong> and a group of his partners, who all shared a common interest in custom vehicles. <br>Ryan began his journey as a vehicle mechanic and engineer for Ford <sup>TM</sup> in his early years.
